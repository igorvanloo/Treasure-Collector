# Treasure Collector
A simple platformer that I made to better learn Pygame.

I learnt a lot from [ClearCode](https://www.youtube.com/c/ClearCode) tutorial and decided to really make it my own with a bunch of new features and game mechanics. 

The asset pack I used was [Treasure Hunters](https://pixelfrog-assets.itch.io/treasure-hunters) as well as some elements from [Ninja Adventure](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack)

The game has 5 levels and I hope you enjoy them!
